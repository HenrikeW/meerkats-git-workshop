# Git workshop repository

This is a test repository for the Meerkats team.
The primary goal of this project is to experiment with Git and Conventional Commits.

We want to develop a gamified social platform to improve knowledge sharing and community within an organization.

The platform is divided into three parts:

- Database
- API
- Web application

The frontend part will be written in React with Typescript using Vite.
